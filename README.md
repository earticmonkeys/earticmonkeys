I am a fresh graduated from Khon Kaen University in Computer Science Major. I have discovered that I enjoy designing and developing websites or mobile applications. After completing an internship as a mobile developer, I became increasingly confident that this is my path!! I love software development so much, perhaps because I also have a passion for design, so I always feel happy whenever I get to develop something according to the design I've sketched out.

🎈 In addition to Software Development, I am interest in UX/UI Design, Quality Assurance also Art and Music.
